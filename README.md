Database Setup
To create the database tables, use the provided SQL commands:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE users (
    id BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email_verified_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    remember_token VARCHAR(100) NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NULL
);

CREATE TABLE products (
    id BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(8, 2) NOT NULL,
    quantity INT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NULL
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    id BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id BIGINT UNSIGNED,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NULL
);

CREATE TABLE order_product (
    id BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id BIGINT UNSIGNED,
    product_id BIGINT UNSIGNED,
    quantity INT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NULL
);

Code Review Report
The code review identified several issues with explanations and recommendations:

Hardcoded Secrets:

Issue: Hardcoded JWT secret keys.
Recommendation: Use environment variables to manage secrets securely.
Missing Validation Rules:

Issue: Insufficient validation for product creation and update.
Recommendation: Implement comprehensive validation rules in the controller.
Inefficient Database Queries:

Issue: N+1 query problem.
Recommendation: Use eager loading to optimize database queries.
Inconsistent Error Handling:

Issue: Inconsistent error handling for authentication failures.
Recommendation: Standardize error responses.
Lack of Unit Tests:

Issue: Missing unit tests for key functionalities.
Recommendation: Add unit tests to cover authentication and order management.
